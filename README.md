# Decentralized_Autonomous_Research_Organization (DARO)

- Create a decentralized platform where researchers can collaborate, fund projects, and share knowledge in a trustless environment. Implement features such as peer review, grant distribution, and intellectual property management using smart contracts.
- Facilitate incentivized contributions and quality assessment mechanisms to ensure the integrity of research outputs.

## Design

DAO Core Contract
- This contract serves as the core of the DARO, managing overall governance, voting mechanisms, and membership management.
- It should include functions for proposing, voting on, and executing decisions such as funding research projects or changing DAO parameters.
- Implement mechanisms for membership management, including joining, leaving, and voting rights.
- Include features for voting delegation and stake-based governance if desired.

Project Proposal Contract
- Each research project proposed to the DARO should have its own contract to manage project-specific details and interactions.
- Include functions for submitting project proposals, reviewing proposals, and voting on whether to fund them.
- Implement features for project milestones, updates, and fund allocation based on voting outcomes.
- Include mechanisms for tracking project progress and disbursing funds accordingly.

Token Contract
- Create a native token for the DARO ecosystem to represent voting rights and ownership within the organization.
- Implement features such as token issuance, transfer, and voting power calculation based on token holdings.
- Integrate with the DAO core contract for governance and voting functionalities.

Intellectual Property Management Contract
- Develop a contract to manage intellectual property rights associated with research outputs generated within the DARO.
- Include functions for registering intellectual property, licensing agreements, and revenue distribution.
- Implement features for enforcing copyright, patent, or other IP protections as per the DAO's policies.

Governance Reward Distribution Contract
- If the DARO incentivizes participation through token rewards, develop a contract to distribute governance rewards to active participants.
- Implement mechanisms for calculating and distributing rewards based on contributions such as voting, proposal submission, or project management.
- Ensure fairness and transparency in reward distribution algorithms.

Access Control and Security Contracts
- Include contracts to manage access control, permissions, and security features within the DARO ecosystem.
- Implement role-based access control mechanisms to ensure appropriate permissions for different actions within the organization.
- Enhance contract security through proper authorization checks and protection against common vulnerabilities.
